I understand you'd like me to continue.

I recently provided detailed instructions for setting up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in your Firebase project and how to test it within your application. This included enabling MFA in Firebase settings, ensuring phone authentication is active, and authorizing your domain for reCAPTCHA.

**Please confirm if you have followed these Firebase Console setup steps and if the MFA functionality is now working correctly for you.**

Your confirmation is important before we move on to new tasks or investigate further. If you're encountering any issues during the setup or testing, please provide the details.
