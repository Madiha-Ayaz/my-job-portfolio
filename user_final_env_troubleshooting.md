The error "Firebase API key is missing. Please check your .env file and ensure VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY is set correctly." continues to appear.

This error is generated by the code in `src/lib/firebase.ts` when `import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` is undefined. This means that, despite our previous steps, the `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` environment variable is **not being loaded** into your running application.

Here is a concise summary of what **you absolutely must verify and do manually**:

1.  **Create/Open `.env` File**: In the *root directory* of your project (where `package.json` is located), ensure you have a file named exactly `.env`.
2.  **Add `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`**: Inside that `.env` file, you must have a line like this:
    ```
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_actual_firebase_api_key_here
    ```
    *   **Crucially**: Replace `your_actual_firebase_api_key_here` with your actual Firebase API key.
    *   **Do NOT** put quotes around the key (e.g., `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="key"` is incorrect).
    *   **Do NOT** include any other prefixes like `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for this specific variable.
3.  **Add `GEMINI_API_KEY`**: If you still intend to use the Gemini Chatbot, also ensure you have:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
    ```
    (Using the value you provided previously: `AIzaSyA3yngl_fNl0ZNVHUzgh2TzwJDc-WO3kSE`)
4.  **Save `.env`**: Save the file.
5.  **FULL Restart**:
    *   **Stop ALL running development servers.** This means going to each terminal where `npm run dev:vite` and `npm run dev:server` are running and pressing `Ctrl+C` until the processes terminate.
    *   **Start BOTH servers again**:
        *   `npm run dev:server`
        *   `npm run dev:vite`

There is no further code change required on my end within the project files. The issue is entirely environmental (how the environment variables are made available to the running processes). You must carefully follow these manual steps.

Please confirm if you have done *all* of these steps, and what the exact output is after the full restart.
