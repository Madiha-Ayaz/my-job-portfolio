I understand you'd like me to continue.

I recently implemented client-side validation and updated the placeholder text for phone numbers to ensure they are entered in **E.164 format** (e.g., `+11234567890`), which Firebase requires. This was to fix the "Invalid format" error you were seeing.

**Please confirm if the phone login functionality is now working correctly for you after entering the phone number in the specified E.164 format.**

Your confirmation is important before we move on to new tasks or investigate further. If you're still encountering issues, please provide any new error messages.
