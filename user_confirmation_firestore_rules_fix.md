I understand you'd like me to continue.

I recently provided detailed instructions for updating your Firebase Firestore security rules to resolve the "Missing or insufficient permissions" error when submitting your contact form. This involves setting rules to allow write access to your `contacts` collection.

**Please confirm if you have followed these Firebase Console steps, published the new rules, and if the contact form is now successfully submitting data to your Firestore database without permission errors.**

Your confirmation is important before we move on to new tasks or investigate further. If you're encountering any issues during the setup or testing, please provide the details.
