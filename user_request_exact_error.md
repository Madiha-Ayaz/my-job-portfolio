I understand you're still encountering an error in `firebase.ts` related to the `import.meta.env` variables.

To help me diagnose this further, please provide the **exact error message** you are seeing in your browser's developer console or in the terminal where your Vite development server is running.

The more specific the error message, the quicker I can identify the root cause.
