I have recently addressed several of your requests:

1.  **Fixed the `recaptchaVerifier.current.clear()` error** in `src/app/auth/phone-login/page.tsx`.
2.  **Implemented Phone Number Login** functionality.
3.  **Implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) management** in `src/app/auth/manage-mfa/page.tsx`.
4.  **Updated the Login Page** (`src/app/auth/login/page.tsx`) to handle MFA challenges.

I previously asked you to test the phone login functionality after the `recaptchaVerifier.current.clear()` fix.

**Please confirm if the Phone Login and MFA functionalities are now working correctly for you.**

Once these are confirmed, I am ready for your next task or any further issues you might have.
