I understand you'd like me to continue. As I previously provided a comprehensive summary of all the features and fixes implemented, and asked if you had any new tasks or issues, I am now waiting for your explicit direction.

If you have no further tasks or issues for me to address, I can conclude this session. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
