I understand you'd like me to continue.

I recently integrated your contact form with Firebase Firestore and provided detailed instructions for enabling and configuring Firestore in your Firebase project. This included enabling the Firestore database and setting up security rules.

**Please confirm if you have followed these Firebase Console setup steps and if the contact form is now successfully submitting data to your Firestore database.**

Your confirmation is important before we move on to new tasks or investigate further. If you're encountering any issues during the setup or testing, please provide the details.
