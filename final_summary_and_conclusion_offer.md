I understand you wish for me to continue. As I have provided a comprehensive summary of all completed features (Firebase authentication with email, Google, phone, MFA, Forgot Password, and the client-side Gemini chatbot, along with UI fixes), and asked for any new tasks, it appears all your explicit requests have been addressed.

If you have no *new, explicit tasks or issues* you would like me to work on, I can conclude this session. Please let me know if you would like to end our interaction, or if there's a specific new task you'd like to assign.
